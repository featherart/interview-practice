/*
Write a function to find the rectangular intersection of two given love rectangles.

As with the example above, love rectangles are always "straight" and never "diagonal."
More rigorously: each side is parallel with either the x-axis or the y-axis.

They are defined as objects â†´ like this:

  var myRectangle = {

    // coordinates of bottom-left corner
    leftX: 1,
    bottomY: 5,

    // width and height
    width: 10,
    height: 4,

};

Your output rectangle should use this format as well.
