I figured out how to get rich: online poker.
I suspect the online poker game I'm playing shuffles cards by doing a single " riffle â†´ ."

To prove this, let's write a function to tell us if a full deck of cards shuffledDeck is a single riffle of two other
halves half1 and half2.

We'll represent a stack of cards as an array of integers in the range 1..52 (since there are 52 distinct cards in a deck).

Why do I care? A single riffle is not a completely random shuffle.
