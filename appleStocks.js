/*
Write an efficient function that takes stockPricesYesterday and returns the best profit I
could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.

For example:

  var stockPricesYesterday = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9];

getMaxProfit(stockPricesYesterday);
// returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)

No "shorting"â€”you must buy before you sell. You may not buy and sell in the same
time step (at least 1 minute must pass).

considerations: you buy before you sell, so the buying time has to be before the selling time -
if prices go down all day you just try to lose least $$

Big(0) of solution in terms of time/space
